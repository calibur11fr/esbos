> > There are these words that have value for everyone . You still do marketing. You will still use pictures, photos, videos, audio... nothing will change except one. You'll use words that have value. Or not, then you'll only have a nice cover for one big NIC. In a world where everyone uses the same communication formats, tools and services, what distinguishes one from another is what they communicate.

Do these words have value for the customer. Because it ultimately determines whether he will want to convert his money into this value. The customer doesn't buy the character, the film only the value, so focus on it.

How many words in wikipedia - so many words do you have. How to choose the right ones today to gain the customer's trust and money? You can find the answer in the Value Power. But there is something else. It could be that lobster syndrome affects you very personally. That you've lost in the fight against copywriting. And there's been a change in your brain under the influence of that loser. But you're not lobster. And that the change due to your loss is not permanent. You can start over.
