# It doesn't matter if it's someone close to you or a stranger.



Don't trust anyone. Never.  Under no circumstances. You are the one who has to trust yourself. Trust your instinct. 

## If you are a believer. Trust in God who is above all else. If not. Do not give anyone control over yourself.



But don't also give control over yourself, things, material things! Do not give control to your desires. And even question your own thoughts!



# Cogito Ergo Sum

So I doubt I am - that's how it was?
